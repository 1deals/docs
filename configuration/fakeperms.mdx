# Why use fake permissions?
> Using fake permissions reduce the chance of a possible corrupt moderator using scripts they found online, which floods **Discord's API** and bans all the members in your guild, or any other harmful action. Fake permissions is a security measure, which ensures that your server's moderators can only ban / kick, ect using the bot.

# How do they work?
> When a role is given fake permissions, such as the `ban members` permission. they will be able to use the `ban` command in crave, but will **not** be able to use the built-in Discord ban feature.

<Warning>
The following commands can only be used by the **server owner**.
</Warning>

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Syntax
,fakeperms add @role permission
```

```javascript Example
,fakeperms add @manager ban_members
```

</CodeGroup>

<Info>
A role can have more than one fake permission setup; just run the same command with a **different** permission you want to add.
